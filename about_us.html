            <p>At Nike, we believe in the power of sport to elevate human potential. Founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, our journey began as a distributor for Onitsuka Tiger, now known as ASICS. In 1971, we launched our first product, the Nike Cortez, and soon rebranded ourselves as Nike, named after the Greek goddess of victory.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete* in the world. We strive to create products, services, and experiences that help athletes achieve their goals, whether on the field, in the gym, or in everyday life.</p>
